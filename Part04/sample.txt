All the magic happens in the lineByLine() function. After making sure that you can open
the given filename for reading, you create a new reader using bufio.NewReader(). Then,
you use that reader with bufio.ReadString() in order to read the input file line by line.
The trick is done by the parameter of bufio.ReadString(), which is a character that tells
bufio.ReadString() to keep reading until that character is found. Constantly calling
bufio.ReadString() when that parameter is the newline character results in reading the
input file line by line. The use of fmt.Print() instead of fmt.Println() for printing the
input line shows that the newline character is included in each input line.
